# Battle Dice Simulator
This is a Python project designed to simulate many games of Battle dice and determine what the most optimal team build is.

# What is Battle Dice?
Battle Dice is a board game designed by Aaron Gordon. It consists of 30 dice, each one called a "Hero". Each Hero is a combination of different abilities.
Players choose a total of 3 heroes to create their team, then roll two dice (unless other modifiers apply) to attack the player to their left, heal themselves,
or apply any number of effects and modifiers to themselves and others. You can learn more about Battle Dice [here](https://www.finalspark.org/battle-dice).
